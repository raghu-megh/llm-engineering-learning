       "*   `if book.get(\"author\")`: Inside the loop, it checks if the current book object has an \"author\" key. The `.get()` method is used here to avoid a KeyError in case the key does not exist.\n",
       "*   `{book.get(\"author\")}`: This dictionary comprehension extracts the author's name from each book that passes the previous condition and creates a new dictionary with just the author's name.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The `yield from` Keyword**\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, let's talk about `yield from`. When you use `yield from`, it allows you to \"delegate\" iteration over another iterable (in this case, the dictionary comprehension) without having to explicitly yield each item one by one. Instead of returning a single value, `yield from` returns an iterator that yields values from the delegated iterable.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, `yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` can be seen as saying: \"For each book that passes the condition, yield its author's name. This will create an iterator that produces these author names one by one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why Use `yield from`?**\n",
       "\n",
       "There are several reasons why someone might prefer using `yield from`:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Efficiency**: Delegating iteration can be more memory-efficient than creating a list or other data structure to store the results.\n",
       "*   **Flexibility**: By yielding each item individually, you have more control over how these items are processed. This is especially useful in generator functions, where the function itself becomes an iterator.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, `yield from` might also make your code harder to understand, as it changes the way iteration works in that part of your code.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Usage**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a simple example to demonstrate this:\n",
       "\n",
       "python\n",
       "def author_names(books):\n",
       "    return yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",

       "    {\"id\": 2, \"title\": \"Book B\", \"author\": None},\n",
       "    {\"id\": 3, \"title\": \"Book C\", \"author\": \"Jane Doe\"}\n",
